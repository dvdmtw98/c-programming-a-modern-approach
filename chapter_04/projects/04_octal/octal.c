/*
Write a program that reads an integer entered by the user and displays it in octal (base 8):

Enter a number between 0 and 32767: 1953
In octal, your number is: 03641

The output should be displayed using five digits, even if fewer digits are sufficient.

Hint: To convert the number to octal, first divide it by 8; the remainder is the last digit of the octal number (1, in this case). Then divide the original number by 8 and repeat the process to arrive at the next-to-last digit. (printf is capable of displaying numbers in base 8, as we'll see in Chapter 7, so thereâ€™s actually an easier way to write this program.)
