### Question 4

Write a single expression whose value is either â€“1, 0, or +1, depending on whether i is less than, equal to, or greater than j, respectively.

### Solution

expression = (i > j) - (i < j)

When i = 1, j = 1 i.e i = j -> expression = 0  
When i = 2, j = 1 i.e i > j -> expression = 1  
When i = 1, j = 2 i.e. i < j -> expression = -1
