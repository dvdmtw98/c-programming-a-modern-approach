The following table shows the daily flights from one city to another:
Departure time          Arrival time
8:00 a.m.               10:16 a.m.
9:43 a.m.               11:52 a.m.
11:19 a.m.              1:31 p.m.
12:47 p.m.              3:00 p.m.
2:00 p.m.               4:08 p.m.
3:45 p.m.               5:55 p.m.
7:00 p.m.               9:20 p.m.
9:45 p.m.               11:58 p.m.

Write a program that asks user to enter a time (expressed in hours and minutes, using the 24-hour clock). The program then displays the departure and arrival times for the flight whose departure time is closest to that entered by the user:
Enter a 24-hour time: 13:15
Closest departure time is 12:47 p.m., arriving at 3:00 p.m.

Hint: Convert the input into a time expressed in minutes since midnight, and compare it to the departure times, also expressed in minutes since midnight. For example, 13:15 is 13 Ã— 60 + 15 = 795 minutes since midnight, which is closer to 12:47 p.m. (767 minutes since midnight) than to any of the other departure times.
