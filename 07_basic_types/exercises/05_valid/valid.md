### Question 5

Which one of the following is not a legal way to write the number 65? (Assume that the character set is ASCII.)  
(a) `'A'`  
(b) `0b1000001`  
(c) `0101`  
(d) `0x41`  

### Solution

(a) Legal. The character `A` corresponds to the decimal code point 65 in ASCII  
(b) Illegal. C does not have a way to denote binary numbers. The binary number represented is correct  
(c) Legal. 101 is the octal representation of the decimal number 65  
(d) Legal. 41 is the hexadecimal representation of the decimal number 65
