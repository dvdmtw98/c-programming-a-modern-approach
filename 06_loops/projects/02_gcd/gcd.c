/*
Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers, then calculates and displays their greatest common divisor (GCD):
Enter two integers: 12 28
Greatest common divisor: 4

Hint: The classic algorithm for computing the GCD, known as Euclid’s algorithm, goes as follows: Let m and n be variables containing the two numbers. If n is 0, then stop: m contains the GCD. Otherwise, compute the remainder when m is divided by n. Copy n into m and copy the remainder into n. Then repeat the process, starting with testing whether n is 0.
