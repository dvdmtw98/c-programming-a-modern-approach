### Question 13

Only one of the expressions ++i and i++ is exactly the same as (i += 1); which is it? Justify your answer.

### Solution

i += 1 is equivalent to i = i + 1. In this expression we increment the value of i by 1 and then save the value back into the variable i.

The expression ++i has the same behavior as i += 1. With ++i the value of i is incremented after which the incremented value is saved in i.

In i++ the current value of i used before the value is incrementing and storing back in i.
