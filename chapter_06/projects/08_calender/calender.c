/*
Write a program that prints a one-month calendar. The user specifies the number of days in the month and the day of the week on which the month begins:
Enter number of days in month: 31
Enter starting day of the week (1=Sun, 7=Sat): 3
         1   2   3   4   5
 6   7   8   9  10  11  12
13  14  15  16  17  18  19
20  21  22  23  24  25  26
27  28  29  30  31

Hint: This program isnâ€™t as hard as it looks. The most important part is a for statement that uses a variable i to count from 1 to n, where n is the number of days in the month, printing each value of i. Inside the loop, an if statement tests whether i is the last day in a week; if so, it prints a new-line character.
