/*
Write a program that computes the factorial of a positive integer:
Enter a positive integer: 6
Factorial of 6: 720

(a) Use a short variable to store the value of the factorial. What is the largest value of n for which the program correctly prints the factorial of n?
(b) Repeat part (a), using an int variable instead.
(c) Repeat part (a), using a long variable instead.
(d) Repeat part (a), using a long long variable instead (if your compiler supports the long long type).
(e) Repeat part (a), using a float variable instead.
(f) Repeat part (a), using a double variable instead.
(g) Repeat part (a), using a long double variable instead.

In cases (e)â€“(g), the program will display a close approximation of the factorial, not necessarily the exact value.
