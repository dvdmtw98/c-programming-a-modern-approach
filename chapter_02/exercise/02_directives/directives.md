### Question 2

Consider the following program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Parkinson's Law:\nWork expands so as to ");
    printf("fill the time\n");
    printf("available for its completion.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

(a) Identify the directives and statements in this program  
(b) What output does the program produce?

### Solution

(a)  
The program contains 1 directive and 4 statements (3 `printf` and 1 `return`)  
**Directives**: `include`  
**Statements**: `printf` & `return`

(b)
```
Parkinson's Law:
Work expands so as to fill the time
available for its completion.
```
