```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Parkinson's Law:\nWork expands so as to ");
    printf("fill the time\n");
    printf("available for its completion.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

i. Identify the directives and statements in this program  

> Directives: `include`  
> Statements: `printf` & `return`

ii. What output does the program produce?

> Parkinson's Law:
> Work expands so as to fill the time
> available for its completion.
